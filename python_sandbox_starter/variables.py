Variable: container for a value, can be of various types

    - Variables are case sensitive e.g. (name and NAME are two different variables)
    - Must start with a letter of underscore
    - can have numbers but not start with them

# Single Assignmet of Variables
# x = 5            # int
# y = 4.8          # float
# name = 'Gatonye' # str
# is_on = False    # bool

# Multiple assignments of Variables
x, y, name, is_on = (5, 4.8, 'Gatonye', False)


# Basic Math
sum = x + y

# Output the Variables
print(x, y, name, is_on, sum)

# Types and Type Casting
# Type Casting: convert one datatype to another
# int to str
x = str(x) 
print(type(x), x)

y = int(y)
print(type(y), y)

z = float(y)
print(type(z), z)
